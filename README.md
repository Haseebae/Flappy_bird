# Flappy Bird
Flappy bird created using pygame library
This is my second project using pygame.

1) Download and install pygame:
  a)Open terminal/cmd and run the following code, If one fails to work please try the alternative:
      "pip install pygame"
      "pip3 install pygame"
      
2) Your system can now import pygame; to check the same, run the following code in preffered editor:
  import  pygame
  
  If you are greeted by pygagme, well and lovely; move on
  If NOT, please try installing pygame using the alternate methods
  
3) Download the zip file from GitHub and extract the Assets folder into the workshop directory( where you keep your files )

4) Refrain from renaming the folders
